## Fear-Based Procrastination

1. Kill Your Fears
	1. Create a Monster list  
       Write down all the things, tasks, responsibilities that are weighing on you.
	2. Choose a Monster. Sit with it for 5 minutes or until the fear goes away.
    3. Come up with at least two ways of handling the task.
    4. Pick one of the methods and give it five minutes of work (timed).  
       When you start losing energy, take a 5--15 minute break.
    5. When the Monster is killed, celebrate! Then move on the next monster.
2. Rapid Personal Therapy
3. Positivity: Start believing that failing is OK

## Relaxation-Based Procrastination

1. Honest Questions
	1. **Think of similar instances in the past.** Ask yourself: What other commitments or responsibilities have I "dropped the ball" on? What other areas of my life could have been improved already if I hadn't procrastinated instead?
    2. **Think of the negatives consequences in the future if not done.** Ask yourself: If I never work on this area, if I never completed this task, what would my life be like in the next week? In the next year? 5 years in the future? 10 years? 20 years? How unhappy would I be? How mediocre my life feel?
    3. **Think of the positive consequences in the future if done.** Ask yourself: If I worked on this area of my life just 30 minutes a day, what would my life be like in the next week? In the next year? 5 years in the future? 10 years? 20 years? How happy would I be? How excellent would my life be?
2. Obsessive Focus
	* Surround yourself with things related to the activity.
    * Start by committing yourself to *thinking* about the task before you commit to working on it.
    * Talk about the activity with others.
    * Put aside things unrelated to your task.
    * Constantly imagine the benefits you'll feel once this task is complete.
3. Break Out of Your Metaloops
	1. Identify when you are stuck in a one of your loops.
    2. Now break it! Do something novel.
    	* Go for a walk
        * Make some food/tea
        * Contact a friend or family member you haven't talked to in awhile
    3. Whatever you do: DO NOT START DOING ANY OF THE THINGS IN YOUR LOOP.
